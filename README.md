# University Javascript (canvas) Matrixes
Homework for "Graphics and Music Programming" course.
The task was to have a shape rotating in 3D space. I made my shape randomly generated. The user can set the speed of X-, Y- and Z-axis rotation (from -5 to 5 degrees per frame).
I was quite satisfied with how it turned out and believe my code is written well so I am uploading it for use in my CV or on Linkedin.
